    to be made (if False, nothing is returned).

    If backup is True, files will be changed in place by calling `mvdef.backup.backup`

    Handle the hand-off to dedicated functions to go from the mvdefs of functions
    to move, first deriving lists of imported names which belong to the mvdefs and
    the non-mvdefs functions (using `parse_mv_funcs`), then constructing an
    'edit agenda' (using `process_ast`) which describes [and optionally
    reports] the changes to be made at the file level, in terms of move/keep/copy
    operations on individual import statements between the source and destination
    Python files.

      mvdefs:     List of functions to be moved
      trunk:      Tree body of the file's AST, which will be separated into
                  function definitions, import statements, and anything else.
      transfers:  List of transfers already determined to be made from the src
                  to the dst file (from the first call to ast_parse)
      report:     Whether to print a report during the program (default: True)

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First, given the lists of mvdef names (m_names) and non-mvdef names
    (nm_names), construct the subsets:

      mv_imps:  imported names used by the functions to move (only in mvdef_names),
      nm_imps:  imported names used by the functions not to move (only in
                nonmvdef_names),
      mu_imps:  imported names used by both the functions to move and the
                functions not to move (in both mvdef_names and nonmvdef_names)

    Potentially 'as a dry run' (if this is being called by process_ast and its
    parameter edit is False), report how to remove the import statements or statement
    sections which import mv_inames, do nothing to the import statements which import
    nonmv_inames, and copy the import statements which import mutual_inames (as both
    src and dst need them).

    Additionally, accept 'transfers' from a previously determined edit agenda,
    so as to "take" the "move" names, and "echo" the "copy" names (i.e. when
    receiving names marked by "move" and "copy", distinguish them to indicate
    they are being received by transfer [from src⇒dst file], for clarity).

    For clarity, note that this function does **not** edit anything itself, it just
    describes how it would be possible to carry out the required edits at the level
    of Python file changes.

    the function, nor assigned in the body of the function), and the value
    of which at each name is a final nested dictionary whose keys are always:
      n:      The [0-based] index of the name's source import statement in the
              AST list of all ast.Import and ast.ImportFrom.
      n_i:    The [0-based] index of the name's source import statement within
              the one or more names imported by the source import statement at
              index n (e.g. for `pi` in `from numpy import e, pi`, `n_i` = 1).
      line:   The [1-based] line number of the import statement as given in its
              corresponding AST entry, which indicates the line number of the
              `import` call, not [necessarily] that of the name (i.e. the name
              may not be located there in the file for multi-line imports).
      import: The path of the import statement, which may contain multiple
              parts conjoined by `.` (e.g. `matplotlib.pyplot`)

    I.e. the dictionary with entries accessed as `mvdef_names.get(m).get(k)`
    for `m` in `mvdefs` and `k` in the subset of AST-identified imported names
    in the function with  if f.name not in mvdefs name `m` in the list of
    function definitions `defs`. This access is handed off to the helper
    function `get_def_names`.

    For the names that were imported but not used, the dictionary is not keyed
    by function (as there are no associated functions), and instead the entries
    are accessed as `nondef_names.get(k)` for `k` in `unused_names`. This access
    is handed off to the helper function `get_nondef_names`.
