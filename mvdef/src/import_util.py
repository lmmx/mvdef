    Summary: get a string which when printed will show the separate parts of an
    import statement in different colours (preamble in blue, alias names in red,
    alias asnames in purple, the word "as" itself in yellow, commas between import
    aliases in light green, and post-matter (a bracket) in light red.

    For an import statement within an asttokens-annotated AST, which comes with
    all subnodes annotated with first and last token start/end positional information,
    access all the tokens corresponding to the import statement name(s) and asname(s).
    
    Do this using a list of lines (i.e. a list of strings, each of which is a line),
    the subset of which corresponding to the import statement `imp_stmt` are given
    by its `first_token.start` and `last_token.end` attributes (in each case, the
    attribute is a tuple of `(line, column)` numbers, and it is conventional to store
    these as a 1-based index, so to cross-reference to a 0-based index of the list
    of lines we decrement this value and store as `imp_startln` and `imp_endln`).
    The subset of lines corresponding to `imp_stmt` is then assigned as `nodelines`,
    and we join this into a single string as `nodestring`.

    Then a new ASTTokens object, `tko`, can be made by parsing `nodestring`, on which
    the `find_tokens` method provides access to each name/asname one at a time, when
    matched to the name/asname string. These name/asname strings are available
    within the `imp_stmt` object via its `names` attribute, which is a list of
    `ast.alias` class instances, each of which has both a `name` and `asname` attribute
    (the latter of which is `None` if no asname is given for the import name).

    `find_tokens` returns a token with attribute `type` of value `1` for a name (1 is
    the index of "NAME" in the `token.tok_name` dictionary), and `startpos`/`endpos`
    attributes (integers which indicate the string offsets within `nodestring`).

    These `startpos` integers are an efficient way to store this list of tokens
    (the "NAME" tokens corresponding to import statement alias names and asnames),
    and so even though it would be possible to store all tokens, I choose to simply
    re-access them with the `tko.get_token_from_offset(startpos)` method.

    At the moment, I only re-access these tokens to retrieve their `endpos` (end
    position offset), which is also an integer and could also be stored easily
    without much problem, however for the sake of clarity I prefer to re-access
    the entire token and not have to construct an arbitrary data structure for
    storing the start and end positions (which could get confusing).

    Lastly, I construct a colourful string representation of the import statement
    by using these start positions and re-retrieved end positions to pull out
    and modify (using the `src.colours`â ¶`colour_str` function) the names and asnames
    (names are coloured red, asnames are coloured purple), and use string slicing
    to swap the ranges that the names and asnames were in in the original
    `nodestring` for these colourful replacements.

    The end result, `modified_nodestring` is then returned, which will then
    display in colour on Linux and OSX (I don't think Windows supports ANSI codes,
    so I made `colour_str` only apply on these platforms).
